NewJeans (Korean: Îâ¥ÏßÑÏä§; RR: Nyujinseu) is a South Korean girl group formed by ADOR. The group is composed of five members: Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, and Hyein. NewJeans is known for their girl next door image and 1990s- and 2000s-indebted pop and R&B songs with influences of various dance and club styles.

NewJeans debuted on July 22, 2022, with the single "Attention", their first number-one song on South Korea's Circle Digital Chart. It was followed shortly afterwards by two other singles, "Hype Boy" and "Cookie". The singles were all featured on their eponymous debut extended play (EP), released in August 2022. In January 2023, they released their first single album, OMG, to commercial success. It was accompanied by two singles, "Ditto" and "OMG". "Ditto" gained widespread popularity, becoming the longest-running number-one song on the Circle Digital Chart and the group's first entry on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.

Their second EP, Get Up, peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200 and sold over one million copies in South Korea. Its lead single, "Super Shy", became the group's highest-charting single on the Billboard Global 200 (number two), the US Billboard Hot 100, and the UK Singles Chart. NewJeans has received rookie awards and were featured in listicles such as Time's Next Generation Leaders and Forbes's Korea Power Celebrity 40. Aside from music, NewJeans has sponsored and collaborated with several brands, including Musinsa [ko], Levi's, Coca-Cola, LG Electronics, Apple Inc., and McDonald's Korea.

NewJeans' music spans genres such as R&B, electropop, and hip hop. It is characterized by mellow beats, atmospheric synthesizers, and live vocals. Their debut EP and first single album OMG are predominantly midtempo pop and R&B that evoke music of the 1990s and 2000s decades. There were comparisons to the sound of late-1990s K-pop girl groups. Music critics also identified elements of mid-2000s electronic and dance styles such as UK garage, Baltimore club, Jersey club, and moombahton. With their second EP Get Up, they ventured more into dance and club music with a more rhythmic production expanding on the group's UK garage-influenced past releases.

Some critics, such as Sheldon Pearce and Minsoo Joshua Kim writing for NPR, described NewJeans' music as soft, contained, and delicate, which is a stark contrast to their contemporaries' "maximalist" and "harsh, buzzing" sounds. Choi Eun-soo of the Hankook Ilbo characterized the group's sound as "easy listening" devoid of "explosive" EDM embellishments that had saturated the market. The Guardian's Laura Snapes described their songs as "sleek and lethally hooky, yet playful and teeming with retro synths and experimental flourishes".

NewJeans' music is mainly produced by South Korean singers 250 and Park Jin-su (also known as FRNK), while the members often participate in songwriting. As the executive producer, Min Hee-jin selects all NewJeans' songs and is responsible for the recording process. Regarding the group's debut EP, Min said she "wanted to break the tacit formula of K-pop and make an album with the music I want". Min disliked "high-pitched parts, awkward raps that suddenly appear, and singing methods that feel uniform" and chose to record without guide vocals, allowing the members to develop their own singing styles. Pearce argued that NewJeans' frequent collaborations with certain producers brought forth a cohesive discography with distinct identity and aesthetic. Four of the members have been credited for songwriting at least once: Danielle for "Attention", "Super Shy", "Cool with You" and "ASAP", Hanni for "OMG" and "Hype Boy", Minji for "Ditto" and Haerin for "New Jeans".
